My name is Stefano, I'm a Linux System Engineer with more than 12 years of experience working with solution vendors (both proprietary and FOSS).
I've been using Linux since 1997 when I installed my first Slackware distribution in order to run <a href="https://eggheads.org/">eggdrop</a>. I love opensource software (FOSS), the hacker culture behind it and all the automation and scaling it enables.

In case you wonder where my nickname originates: Nevarsin comes out of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ages-Chaos-Darkover-Book-ebook/dp/B00J8V3SRO/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=storm+queen+marion+zimmer&qid=1575993072&sr=8-1">Stormqueen! from Marion Zimmer Bradley</a> and is the name of a monastery where gifted young mages were trained to manage their powers. It has been the nickname of my beloved World of Warcraft character until adult life kicked in :)

I'm a unusual traveler (me and my wife build our own Van as documented in <a href="https://www.upandvan.com">our work in progress blog (Italian) </a>) and digital privacy advocate.

I absolutely would love to get any feedback on the content I publish. Feel free to contact me <a href="/contact/">here</a>

Enjoy your visit, wish you all the best.
