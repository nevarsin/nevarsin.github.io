# Why can't I hold all these free apps?
Supposedly you are someone that, in 2020, still managed to live without a smartphone. Following the recent CoronaVirus outbreak you feel that it's time to purchase one; so you go to your local electronic store and start browsing: Wow! Nowadays smartphones can be cheap. You fetch a low end device for less than 200â‚¬, it feel more than enough for your needs and you'll sure need to save for all the software that probably will be needed. You know, like the antivirus, the office suite or games: everything you paid for when you got your PC. In this case, apparenty, the operating system is called Android and it's free of charge.

You power up the phone, initialize it, say yes to all those dialogs asking you to authorize this and that; you finally reach the home screen. Your "digitally born" nephew told you that everything is downloaded via a store. You open the Play Store application and start searching for Microsoft Word... it's free! And Excel too! Download! Authorize! Agree! Then you'll probably need a gps navigator, those weren't cheap at all 15 years ago; it's bundled and free as well! Authorize! Agree! 

Games? Free. Language translator? Free. Email service? Free!

> How come all this work-of-art is free? Do people working in IT not get paid anymore?

# Your data is the currency aka "it's not what you do, it's how you do it"
In order to understand we have to get back to the early 2000s, right after the ["dotcom" stock market bubble blew up.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble): Google was one of the survivors, the technology behind their search engine was already ahead of the market. It leveraged user search queries to improve result quality. There was one problem tho: they weren't making any money out of it and investors were running out of patience.

They figured out that, yes, sponsored search results was the way to salvation but a huge problem was still ahead: those ads needed to be clicked and the only way to make that happen was to make them as relevant as possible, more than the actual results.

One day some of the Google search engineers reported a massive peak of searches on a not-so-famous writer that happened in a really short amount 
of time. After an in-depth analysis they found out that this was due to the local "Who wants to be a millionarie" asking a specific question on the subject. This was it. The goldmine was finally found. 

> The key to make advertising more attractive was focusing on the **behavioural surplus** of users rather than their actual activities. 

# Data collection
This discovery lead to a silent new "gold rush" where more and more companies making data collection their primary source of revenue. You know the names: the already mentioned Google, Facebook, post-Ballmer Microsoft (Windows 10 is free, isn't it?) and Amazon. 

But this is not just for the big tech. There are two major business model, depending on your size:
- You're one of the big tech: you can "organize the world's information" and use it to boost the click-through ratio of your ads. 
- You're not one of the big tech: you can offer your services for free and sell your data collection to the players above. [Take Avast "free" antivirus as an example](https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-cost-of-avasts-free-antivirus-companies-can-spy-on-your-clicks). 

So, while Google developed new services to "make your life easier" and collect more real life data (e.g. [Google Maps](https://www.inverse.com/article/32886-google-map-privacy-variation) the rest of the marked populated a terrifying landscape of new "free" services aimed specifically at your behavioural surplus. 

You know have apps, [mouses](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126245/wacom-tablet-app-tracking-google-analytics), [thermostats](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/what-google-can-really-do-with-nest-or-really-nests-data/0) collecting and selling your data.
