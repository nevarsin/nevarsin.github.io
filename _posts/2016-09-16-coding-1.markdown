Reasons why you can (and you should) use an old raspberry to get a full managed home router (antispam included).

(the mighty Raspberry Pi 1 Model B)

My family's bandwidth needs are limited to web-browsing and some occasional video stream but, unfortunately, my home is located where fiber internet connection is not yet in sight. 

Luckily Italy is one of the countries with the cheapest mobile connections (I currently get 50GB/month for about 10€) so 4G is a viable solution.

The thing is: 4G routers are more expensive (starting from 80€) and less available than their xDSL counterparts so I set to find an alternative. 

What I needed was:
- a decent WiFi AP
- a 4G modem of sort
- an actual router


For the first one any leftover cheap wifi xDSL modem/router (you or a relative may have one left by some TLC operator) will do.

I missed the second one so I had to make <a href="https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B01M3POL6X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> a small purchase </a>. I chose this because of the price and because it was documented as linux friendly.

Lastly: I needed the intelligent packet wrangler. That's where the Raspberry comes in handy.
The absolute advantage of setting up your "raspi-router" is, as usually with Linux and FOSS, the freedom to set your custom rules incl. dns filtering.

## Connecting
----------------------

- An ethernet cable will connect one of the ports of your router/ap to the Raspberry only ethernet port
- Of course the 4G USB modem needs to be plugged in one of the USB ports. Given the fair amount of current it will draw I would suggest, for this purpose, to use a <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Anker-Trasferimento-porte-Sottile-Adattatore/dp/B0192W3HX8/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3ON67LCLPVW14&keywords=usb+hub+alimentato&qid=1575496906&smid=A2PGPJL0BBLHLX&sprefix=usb+hub%2Caps%2C214&sr=8-4"> powered USB hub</a>.

## Configuring

### Router/AP
1. Configure the wifi access (SSID, WPA2/3 Key, etc). Refer to your device documentation in order to do so.
2. Set a static IP address on the device (I used 192.168.100.10/255.255.255.0)
