# Why can't I hold all these free apps?
Supposedly you are someone that, in 2020, still managed to live without a smartphone. Following the recent CoronaVirus outbreak you feel that it's time to purchase one; so you go to your local electronic store and start browsing: Wow! Nowadays smartphones can be cheap. You fetch a low end device for less than 200â‚¬, it feel more than enough for your needs and you'll sure need to save for all the software that probably will be needed. You know, like the antivirus, the office suite or games: everything you paid for when you got your PC. In this case, apparenty, the operating system is called Android and it's free of charge.

You power up the phone, initialize it, say yes to all those dialogs asking you to authorize this and that; you finally reach the home screen. Your "digitally born" nephew told you that everything is downloaded via a store. You open the Play Store application and start searching for Microsoft Word... it's free! And Excel too! Download! Authorize! Agree! Then you'll probably need a gps navigator, those weren't cheap at all 15 years ago; it's bundled and free as well! Authorize! Agree!

Games? Free. Language translator? Free. Email service? Free!

> How come all this work-of-art is free? Do people working in IT not get paid anymore?

# Your data is the currency aka "it's not what you do, it's how you do it"
In order to understand we have to get back to the early 2000s, right after the ["dotcom" stock market bubble blew up.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble): Google was one of the survivors, the technology behind their search engine was already ahead of the market. It leveraged user search queries to improve result quality. There was one problem tho: they weren't making any money out of it and investors were running out of patience.

They figured out that, yes, sponsored search results was the way to salvation but a huge problem was still ahead: those ads needed to be clicked and the only way to make that happen was to make them as relevant as possible, more than the actual results.

One day some of the Google search engineers reported a massive peak of searches on a not-so-famous writer that happened in a really short amount 
of time. After an in-depth analysis they found out that this was due to the local "Who wants to be a millionarie" asking a specific question on the subject. This was it. The goldmine was finally found. 

> The key to make advertising more attractive was focusing on the **behavioural surplus** of users rather than their actual activities. 

# Data collection
This discovery lead to a silent new "gold rush" where more and more companies making data collection their primary source of revenue. You know the names: the already mentioned Google, Facebook, post-Ballmer Microsoft (Windows 10 is free, isn't it?) and Amazon. 

But this is not just for the big tech. There are two major business model, depending on your size:
- You're one of the big tech: you can "organize the world's information" and use it to boost the click-through ratio of your ads. 
- You're not one of the big tech: you can offer your services for free and sell your data collection to the players above. [Take Avast "free" antivirus as an example](https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-cost-of-avasts-free-antivirus-companies-can-spy-on-your-clicks). 

So, while Google developed new services to "make your life easier" and collect more real life data (e.g. [Google Maps](https://www.inverse.com/article/32886-google-map-privacy-variation)) the rest of the market populated a terrifying landscape of new "free" services aimed specifically at your behavioural surplus. 

You now have apps, [mouses](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126245/wacom-tablet-app-tracking-google-analytics), thermostats collecting and (possibly) selling your data. And we're not talking about minor cash, it represents a whole business model for most of the companies that decided to join the surveillance capitalism.

# Why this matters
Because, as Ed Snowden stated perfectly, saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like not caring about free speech because you have nothing to say.

The data that today gets used "only" to sell you a new fancy consumer gadget tomorrow can be used to profile you and have effects into your real life. Think about how insurance companies can adjust your premiums based on your actual driving habits. Or how your credit score can be affected by the online purchases you make. 

Or the scariest case: how can this affect modern democracy (the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal is the most prominent example) by putting you in a tailored political bubble, polarizing opinion and eventually disrupting what's left of honest and mature intellectual challege.

# What can one do (and I'm doing)

| *you duck it!* |

From a small scale point of view, the most practical course of action is to limit your collectable data footprint. How? Some ideas:
- limit the "free" services you employ
- stop feeding free of charge training and profiling data to social networks (your mental health will improve too)
- try to install as less apps as possible on your devices. Data is collected even when they're not in use.
- avoid smart speakers ([yes, they listen](https://www.consumerreports.org/smart-speakers/smart-speakers-that-listen-when-they-shouldnt/)).
- limit the connected "things" you deploy at home
- switch to open source, audited and clear business-modelled services

# Degoogling
The most subtle effect surveillance capitalism has had to us is addiction. Google, as the inventor and champion of this discipline, has quietly created an ecosystem of free and convenient services that bilions of people use everyday without ever needing to consider a competitive alternative. Think about it:
- Search
- Maps
- Translate
- Gmail
- Calendar/Contacts
- Drive
- Youtube

They are massive part of our lives and society expects you to be fully perfomant, in your everyday life, thanks to those services (When was the last time you had a street route described with words?)

This is why I decided to start a journey to get ride on anything directly supplied by Google, managing my own infrastructure, finding alternative and paying for services that I value and trust.

The next article series on this topic will describe how I:
- Switched my family file, calendar and contact sharing to a managed [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance
- Flashed my Android phone with [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/), a collaborative Android distribution that doesn't employ Google Services by default
- Migrated to an ethic and paid email services, using my own domain name 
- Found a huge amount of replacement client apps 
- Stopped feeding my searches to Google

# Jeez, that looks painfully long. Isn't there something I can do right now?
Of course. You can start today by [switching](https://duckduckgo.com/install) your default search engine to DuckDuckGo: they don't track you and they don't log your data. Ever.

Stop uploading personal content to social media.

And you can start reading and spreading awareness on the issue.

- Permanent Record by Edward Snowden

# My final reccomendations
This is very sensitive topic, while at first I considered it a "first world problem", once you start considering the real life implications, it won't look like a joke anymore.

Stay tuned for more tech approaches to the matter and as always feel free to contact me and share.
